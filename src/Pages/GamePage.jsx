    killer: 'Sophia Reynolds',
    motive: `Sophia Reynolds, the diligent and intelligent assistant, harbored deep resentment and fear due to Jonathan's erratic behavior and threats to ruin her career. Jonathan discovered that Sophia had been embezzling funds from the company and was planning to expose her. In a fit of desperation, knowing that her career and future were on the line, she decided to take drastic measures. On the night of the murder, Sophia confronted Jonathan in his study. The argument escalated, and in a moment of panic, she struck him with the heavy paperweight from his desk. To make it look like a locked-room mystery, she meticulously staged the scene before locking the door from the inside and escaping through a hidden passage she had discovered while working late nights. The ominous note, "Secrets die with you," was meant to divert suspicion and add to the mystery.
    Sophia's meticulous nature and intimate knowledge of Jonathan's routines allowed her to create a convincing alibi, but subtle clues, such as inconsistencies in her story and traces of the hidden passage, ultimately lead to her downfall.`
